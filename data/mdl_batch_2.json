      "synopsis": "In 1965 (Showa 40), Kunikata Chiyoko visits Sasaki, her father Umeya Shokichi’s former secretary. Shokichi founded the first major movie studio in Japan and was called the movie industry’s soldier of fortune. However, he also had another unknown side. In his will, Shokichi who had never breathed a word, ordered that the matter not be publicized. However, Sasaki wants to tell the world about the journey that Shokichi and his wife Toku who had supported him throughout life, had taken and hands a wooden box to Chiyoko. It is filled with the couple’s secret life which Chiyoko does not know about. Shokichi was born in 1868 (Meiji 1), the son and heir of a Nagasaki trade merchant. However, he ran away from home at the age of 25 because of his daring character and went missing. Fed up with his profligate son, Shokichi’s father Kichigoro took in Toku, who was born and raised in Iki, as his adopted daughter and heir. But two years later, Shokichi unexpectedly came home from Hong Kong. His father asked him to marry Toku before his death and the two who had just met became husband and wife.",

Deciding he'd rather be the hunter than the prey, Jim sets out to wipe out his enemies before they can wipe out him, though it turns out to be more complicated than he imagined. Gongwu Gogap also stars Sandra Ng as Jim's wife, with their sometimes-stormy relationship providing a subplot.",

      "synopsis": "Togane Takichi, the CEO of a construction company, is shot dead in the street in Nishi Shinjuku in Tokyo. The only eyewitness, Odagiri Naoto, refuses to cooperate with the police for some reason. Fukamachi Kotaro, a senior member of the IR Analysis Office, is ordered by Nitta Yukihiko, the head of the First Investigative Division, to handle Odagiri. The newly established office was set up on the pretext of tracking and monitoring suspects and witnesses to advance investigations by using the many surveillance cameras and GPS trackers installed in Tokyo. However, it actually plays a supporting role to the First Investigative Division. In fact, Odagiri’s wife Chiharu died in an accident in Numazu five years earlier. But six months ago, he saw a woman who looked just like her in Tokyo. Even though he consulted the police, he was brushed off. This is why he completely refuses to assist the police. The IR Analysis Office begins an investigation to determine the identity of the woman whom Odagiri saw and prove that she is a different person. Fukamachi and his subordinate Izumoto Noriko quickly head to Numazu where the obtain information on Chiharu’s secret meeting with Togane. Just as suspicions about Chiharu’s involvement in Togane’s death emerge, Fukamachi is told by Nitta that he no longer needs to be involved in Odagiri’s case. He and Noriko continue the investigation on their own and learn that another woman had been pretending to be Chiharu. They soon discover that the impersonator is Nakatani Asuka, who is a hairstylist in Tokyo. However, Asuka says she knows nothing. Meanwhile, it becomes very likely that the suspect in Togane’s murder is a Vietnamese who had company related trouble. The First Investigative Division makes their rounds of the Vietnamese restaurants in Tokyo as they focus on a person with a red star tattoo on the neck. Before long, they learn that Odagiri had met Togane in the past and there are also records of a long travel history to Vietnam. In addition, they find out that Asuka’s father committed suicide in Vietnam too. What is Asuka’s motive for getting close to Odagiri? And what is Odagiri’s true intent?\n(Source: Official Website)",

Each story is presented in a one scene one shot sequence with no particular camera movements?such as zooming in, sound effects or editing measures. The stories are short?almost like vignettes in literature?and express highly original ideas through cinematic fun. Each scene is invariably funny and surprises us with an unexpected twist. The film includes a homage to silent comedy and comedy horror as well as stories that combine slapstick comedy and puns. We are reminded of the film industry´s systematic flaw that limits the running time to more or less two hours. The film makes us reconsider the meaning of cinema.\n\n(Source: JIFF)",

      "synopsis": "Bara no Konrei ~Mayonaka ni Kawashita Yakusoku~ is a movie released by Malice Mizer. It is a silent film with a storyline similar to Dracula and other vampire-based stories with Japanese and English captions for dialogue.\n\nKlaha and Cecil are set to get married. However, their wedding must be postponed because Klaha is summoned from England to Romania on business. Klaha goes to Transylvania and arrives at the Earl of Dracula's castle, where he is staying. The Earl seems welcoming, but Klaha has strange experiences while staying there. On his arrival, he notices a painting of the Earl's deceased wife, who looks very much like Cecil. 2 nights later, the Earl agrees to buy a house in England. That same night, after having a nightmare, Klaha wakes up to see a coffin leaving the grounds. While looking for the Earl, Klaha sees the painting again, but this time, the word \"Cecil\" is written under it. Too late does Klaha realise that the Earl is a vampire. He immediately leaves to try to catch up with him.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

      "synopsis": "56-year-old Kururi Takuzo (Yoshida Kotaro) is the third-generation owner of a traditional Japanese confectionery shop ‘Kururiya’ in Kototoibashi, Tokyo. He received a strict education from his father, who was a man with an old-fashioned way of thinking, and his skills in making the shop’s signature dango have surpassed his father’s. But in his personal life, he is thrice-divorced and cannot help himself when it comes to women. His hobby is to go for walks in town with the antique single-lens reflex camera that his father bought for him when he was a child, and capture the scenery of the good old-fashioned Tokyo which will change someday. One day, a young man visits ‘Kururiya’ while they are in the middle of preparations. His name is Takakura Masahiro (Fukushi Seiji) and he is the son of Takuzo and his first wife. The atmosphere between father and son is awkward due to the suddenness of this visit. It has been a while since they last met. Disregarding the presence of a shocked Sudo Akane, the shop’s part-time employee, Masahiro tells his father that he would like him to meet with the girl that he is going to marry soon. Several days later, Takuzo goes to the venue despite whining about it. Masahiro’s fiancee Ebihara Rumi (Suzuki Anne) is cheerful and sensible, and makes a very good impression. Even after they introduce themselves and make general conversation, Rumi’s aunt Fujiwara Minako (Kuroki Hitomi) does not show up. So they have no choice but to proceed with the meal as they wait for her. Just when they feel that they have reached their limit, she finally appears. In that moment, Takuzo inwardly notes that she has dispelled his notion of an aunt. However, as the meal progresses, a disquieting air starts to settle over the table. Minako flares up at what Takuzo talks about and a heated exchange ensues between the two of them. This develops into a quarrel even though this is their first meeting. It is the worst encounter. But fate will not let them go.",

One month later, the Supreme Court decided that Lee was not guilty. \n\nThis documentary is composed of interviews with the people directly affected by the dissolution of the party, people around them, and those who had followed the case. As we watch, the interviews reveal differences in people’s opinions and stances. By tracking on such different positions, public opinion, false information, and perceptions on the Constitution, democracy and North Korea, we come face to face with a belated question. What have we missed?\n\n(Source: Hancinema)",

Siu Bo complies, but as soon as he gets to the future, he spends the majority of his time messing around with new policeman pal Chiu (Dicky Cheung). Soon Wai Siu Bo has more problems: evil bad guys show up to stop him from saving the Emperor, and two of his seven wives leap forward to help and harass Siu Bo into completing his mission and heading home.

      "synopsis": "Private detective Wada exudes a tough, unflappable air. He has an office in a multi-tenant building in a corner of the city and his principle is to face ordinary and modest requests head-on. He wants to live quietly, but during investigations into what seem like ordinary requests, he always finds himself getting involved in the greatest cases of the century without knowing why. Despite having a fate where cases cannot leave him alone, Wada persists in taking care of the small cases. A meddling small-time hoodlum and thug, homeless man with the air of an informant and a convenience store employee who loves the occult sniff out the complicated situations that Wada has with extraordinary speed. Free and in search of excitement, they try to get involved in his cases. One day, Wada gets a request from a seemingly highly strung graduate student who feels he is being watched by someone and wants help. There are many such requests in Wada’s line of work. But most cases get struck out. When Wada goes to his client’s house to take a look, there is nothing suspicious. He is about to tell him that the investigation has been completed when he sees a totally unexpected scene. Wada steps outside to confirm what he saw, only to be threatened from behind all of a sudden and dragged away. His abductors are the Time Patrol Team which is on some mission. Meanwhile, a mysterious woman like an assassin suddenly enters Wada’s client’s house and stabs him. Wada gets entangled in yet another outrageous case again …",

This level of output is all the more remarkable for the fact that Japanese animation is still mostly hand-drawn, frame-by-frame, a hugely labor-intensive process now rare elsewhere. Actor Sato Takeru joins us as we take a tour of anime's history and learn about the challenges faced by a fast-evolving industry. \n\n(Source: NHK-World)",

      "synopsis": "Kusakabe Gengo, of the Tsukigase domain in Western Japan, is handed an order to execute the chief retainer, Matsuura Shogen. Kusakabe and Matsuura are childhood friends and also went to the same kendo training school. They were once bound by a firm friendship, but took different paths and fell out as a result of some incident. The rumours are that Shogen has incurred displeasure because he is hindering the rise of the lord of the domain. However, he is known to the public as an artist so it would look bad if he were publicly executed. Gengo, who has been ordered to handle it as a fight due to a personal grudge, searches for the place for Shogen to die. He decides to visit Shogen for the first time in 20 years. When the paths of the two men cross again as they approach old age, fate starts moving again.\n\n~~ Adapted from the 2007 historical novel \"Ginkan no Fu\" by Hamuro Rin.",

To prevent wrongful convictions, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police’s First Investigative Division establishes the Evidence Verification Section, tasked with validating closed cases. However, the section primarily corrects minor errors and stamps reports as \"verification completed.\" Led by the disillusioned veteran detective, the team is often seen as ineffective. When Deputy Inspector Shinkai Akira (Mizuki Arisa), a sidelined elite, is assigned as the new leader, she challenges the status quo, uncovering overlooked evidence and revealing the true criminals.\n\n(Source: MyDramaList)",

      "synopsis": "A U.S. helicopter crashes and explodes into a classroom in Okinawa International University. Because of the incident, Yamashiro Ryota thinks back to the blue sky of Okinawa 52 years ago. Ryota is in the 6th grade of Miyamori Elementary School. He plays with his friends Shigeru, Yutaka and other classmates. Hiroko Miyagi is transferred to his class, which makes Ryota happy. Under the blue sky in Okinawa, residents live peacefully.\r\nThen on June 30, 1959, a U.S. jet fighter becomes engulfed in flames and crashes into a residential area where Ryota's elementary school is situated. The screaming children flee from the scene. Ryota tries to help Hiroko, but Hiroko is already dead. Now in 2012, Ryota, who is now a widower, lives in his daughter's home. His grandchild Ryuichi is a university student. Ryuichi begins a report on the 1959 fallen U.S. jet fighter incident with his colleagues. The bereaved families in the Miyamori area of Okinawa still suffer. Ryuichi decides to hold a peace and sky concert, but problems occur for Ryuichi.",

They have a conflict, and Suzuki Gen is soon kicked out of the research room at a university.\n\n7 years later, Suzuki Gen learns that Tashiro Megumi's body was found. Suzuki Gen hired a private detective to locate her. Megumi has a 6-year-old son named Shinji. Tashiro Megumi has not contacted her younger sister Natsumi in nearly 10 years. Meanwhile, younger sister Natsumi begins to live with her nephew Shinji, but she doesn't get used to living with a child, and her financial situation is poor. Natsumi leaves Shinji with Suzuki Gen, whom she met at the hospital. At the hospital, Suzuki Gen told Natsumi that he is Shinji's father. Natsumi, though, feels uncomfortable with Suzuki Gen's obsession with Shinji. She decides to go with them. \n\nMeanwhile, Detective Kuroiwa Tadashi suspects that Megumi was murdered, and he watches Suzuki Gen. During his investigation, Tadashi Kuroiwa meets Suzuki Gen's former boss, Sakakibara Michitaka. Michitaka is shocked when learning of Shinji's existence. He believes Shinji might be a human clone made through Suzuki Gen's cloning technology. \n\n(Source: Amazon)",

One day, he downs litres of alcohol in a drinking contest and misses sending his lord off as he leaves Edo for Kuju. Released from service for this blunder, Akame becomes a wandering samurai.\n\nIn the mountains of Hakone, he suddenly appears before the procession of the Wako domain’s feudal lord, whom fencing instructor Furuta Jusaburo serves. Plunging right into the middle of the retinue, Akame snatches away the lance, which is the symbol and prestige of a feudal family, without killing anyone. He goes on to steal lances from other processions in acts of retaliation.\n\nFor Furuta, suffering defeat is out of the question. To protect his domain and family, he takes it upon himself to meet Murase and proposes an alliance between the Wako, Fuki and Ushizu domains. With the fate of the feudal families in their hands, Furuta and Murase pursue Akame. But what is Akame’s motive?",

However, on that day, a landslide occurred on the single road leading to the village, and it took quite a significant amount of time for the police to arrive. At that time, there were 8 people in the mansion. Each of them had a secret that they couldn't tell anyone and had a motive for murder. In order to get closer to the truth of the incident, the cast, who portray the characters, engage in improvised reasoning that leads to an unpredictable ending!\n\n(Source: Japanese = madarame-misuo.com || Translation = MyDramaList)",

Yu is saving his first time for the ideal girl, and he finally meets her in the form of Yoko, a sassy man-hating schoolgirl who beats up guys for the heck of it. Yu falls hard for Yoko, but courting her is no easy matter, especially when fanatical cult recruiter Aya also has her eyes on Yoko.",

To escape her dismal existence, she writes gothic stories and daydreams. Her life changes in a big way when she’s suddenly befriended one day by a pretty, sophisticated girl who also happens to be named Tomie. Fascinated by her new friend, she invites her home. When her father gets a look at his daughter’s guest, he has to do a double take–she’s the absolute spitting image of his first love, who was murdered 20 some odd years ago by his best friend (who also fell for her, then took his own life). She had made such an impression on him, in fact, that he’d named his daughter after her. He learns soon enough that his daughter’s friend is indeed the same Tomie he’d loved, miraculously alive and as young and beautiful as ever. He soon falls under her spell again but learns he must pay a terrible price to be with her.\n\n~~ Adapted from the manga series \"Tomie\" (富江) by Ito Junji (伊藤潤二).",

      "synopsis": "Kashiwagi Natsuko, who has stayed in the US for a long time, is a new investigator of Adjust Research, an insurance investigation firm. She possesses scientific genius and vast personal wealth, but has a tendency to feel out of place in Japanese society which is overly logical. On the other hand, Tono Aki is a veteran investigator in the same company. Born in the old part of Tokyo and a former delinquent, she is rather stingy because she lived in poverty when she was growing up. However, she has superb memory and animal instincts. Natsuko and Aki make an odd combination as they confront ingenious crimes associated with insurance money and expose the truth.",
