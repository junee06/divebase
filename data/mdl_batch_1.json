Food mislabelling, high school girls’ compensated dating, businesses that exploit employees, law-evading drugs … … There is a man who keeps on fighting despite lamenting about the high number of cases. He is Asakura Sohei of the Community Safety Bureau’s Special Crime Prevention Division at the National Police Agency. Because the Special Crime Prevention Division, which is also known as Tokubou, only has two persons, even the police do not know what it does. On the outside, it seems like an easy position. However, evil that is not brought to justice is his enemy. Tokubou’s mission behind the scenes is to exterminate this vermin which everyone wants to eliminate but has little choice except to let it go unchecked.",

One day, Momoko learns that Omiya Masaki, an extremely defiant transfer student, has not received adequate education because of his family situation, and gives him personal coaching, but she is criticized for forming an inappropriate relationship with a student. How does she talk about “love”, “dreams” and the “meaning of school”?",

Takuma is assigned to protect politician Eikichi, who was involved in the investigation of the Tokyo Sky Land explosion 26 years ago, which killed both Akira and Takuma’s fathers.

A donor is found, and Akira, along with Yukari, assists in the transplant surgery on the day of the procedure.\n\n(Source: MyDramaList)",

He has never held a proper job so far and the only one he opens up to and converses with is Erina, an AI app in his smartphone. Naoki’s father Takahiko is unemployed and drinks daily. However, Naoki’s mother Toshie indulges his father. Naoki hates his father and struggles as he lives without any hope of change. Then one day, Naoki finally finds a job at a small photography office on the strength of his photo editing skills. Under the guidance of his boss Ogaki Yu, Naoki gets involved in the business of creating fake photos to show off on social media. One day, a woman called Ishii Saya visits the office with a strange request. She says her husband Atsushi is missing but she wants to create photos which look like he is on a trip. Saya posts the fake photos made by Naoki on social media and maintains the pretense that Atsushi is travelling. Naoki falls for Saya and also makes friends with her daughter Aoi. However, Saya does not talk about what happened between her and her husband or where he is right now. The mystery keeps deepening. Naoki begins to have misgivings, wondering whether she killed her husband and insidiously made him her accomplice. In the end, he gets to the unexpected truth …",

His life and his brother's were different. It has been a life in a \"minor role\" that would not draw anyone's attention. With the death of his brother, a man appears and accuses Wakiya of causing his brother's death. He unexpectedly loses consciousness, and finds himself on a ship called 'Piece Vote' when he comes to his senses. Someone calls out, \"It's game time!\" and requests that everyone tell him their real thoughts. The passengers confess to involuntary crimes which they had feigned ignorance of. Unbeknownst to the passengers aboard the ship, countless cameras have been installed in its interior, and these images are being transmitted all over Japan. They are on a perilous game which will be decided by the votes of spectators in Japan. Wakiya had no problems or grouses about his life in a minor role. That's what he had thought ... ... until he went aboard the ship.",

      "synopsis": "A GagaOOLala Original TV series documenting the lives of LGBTQ individuals in Hong Kong, one of the most economically developed regions in Asia, with one of fastest paced lifestyles in the world. In recent years, the LGBTQ community has become more hopeful, and started to stand for what they believe in. People work hard for a better future in this small city.\n\nEpisode 1: Living Proud\n\"Queer Asia - Hong Kong\" invites writer and host Cheuk Wan Chi to introduce her LGBTQ friends to us. We will hear about their unique journeys. Jun Lee, a rising film director, often writes about the various difficult situations gay people face in real life. He discusses his first feature film, Tracey, featuring the story of a transgender woman. Beatrice, a real transgender woman from Hong Kong, talks about her journey from a self-hatred young boy to the confident woman she is today. The newlyweds, William and Clement, share their romantic love story and the feeling of fulfillment they got after becoming lifelong partners. Last but not least, Anthony Man Ho Fung, a pastor, shares the struggle of fighting for LGBTQ rights over the past twenty years. He is devoted to his faith and proud of his past.\n\nEpisode 2:  A Tribute to Ellen\nOn this second stop, Cheu Wan Chi brings us to the record company \"People Mountain People Sea\", where one girl has accomplished many of her dreams here: Ellen Joyce Loo. the two of them meet for an insightful one on one. Ellen's face glows with love and happiness when talking about about her wife, her family and their relationship. However, her expression changes when it comes to discuss LGBTQ issues. Moreover, we document her performance during the International Family Day in Taiwan. She shows to everyone how she has seized every moment of her life, filling it with passion and love and without regrets.\n\nEpisode 3: Our Hong Kong\nDiversity is intrinsic to Hong Kong. Yet, at the same time, there is an important gap between the different communities. A group of foreigners living in Hong Kong seek to know more about each culture and connect the different communities together. Marty is the main person behind this initiative. He has a perfect family and shares with us his journey immigrating to Hong Kong with his partner and son. The episode also introduces the success of the \"Gay Games 2022\" application and the consequences for the city. Marty is also the founder of \"Rainbow Family\" , an organization that helps different communities build their own family. During a forum for \"Rainbow Family,\" he introduces a Filipino lesbian director Cha. She shares her life story with her daughter, showing the world that children can grow up happily with two mothers. Lastly, the founder of \"Out in HK\" Dennis explains the reasons why he used sports to bring change to the LGBTQ community in Hong Kong.\n\nEpisode 4: Welcome to Our World\nIn this last episode, we will meet the lesbian and transgender Filipino workers that live in Hong Kong. The Filipino workers have lived in Hong Kong for more than half of their lives, but we can still how they are still being mistreated in comparison with the Western immigrants. They serve many different communities but encounter great prejudice, neglection, and suppression. We interview a transgender professor in Hong Kong, Brenda, as well as transman Marrz. Marrz moved to Hong Kong when he was 18 in search of freedom. Lastly, it is Sunday, the happiest day for the Filipino workers, their only day off. We interview Sheila, a member of Gabriela Female Right Group. She tells us about the many issues the Filipino workers face in Hong Kong.You can see all their challenges and struggles, but also their resilience. On Sunday in Hong Kong, the streets are filled with people dancing and gathering freely in high spirits. The whole city seems to be surrounded with joy and happiness.\n\n(Source: GagaOOLala)",

      "synopsis": "Miyuki Nakajima is a Japanese singer-songwriter and radio personality whose sales have been estimated at more than 21 million copies. \r\nFor Westerners,she can be described as the female Japanese equivalent of Bob Dylan -- she's a bit younger than Dylan, and her guitar-based, intelligent, and wordy folk songs are heavier on melancholy than social issues, but she's also enjoyed a long career and plays a similarly important role for Japanese popular music and the country's modern culture in general: suffice to say, she's the only musician to be included in the National Language Council of Japan in the ‘90s. She's not just acclaimed, but commercially successful, too: most of her 30-plus albums charted in the Top Ten, her sales totaled over 21 million units, and that's not counting over 90 songs she wrote for other artists, and numerous covers of her works performed throughout East Asia. Moreover, she built her reputation while consciously abstaining from appearing on TV, which is almost unheard of in Japan. In 2009, Nakajima was awarded a Medal of Honor by the Japanese government.",

      "synopsis": "Inspector Kazamatsuri Kyoichiro of Kokuritsu Police Precinct is the boss of Hosho Reiko. He does not know that the riddles of the cases he is in charge of are always solved by Kageyama, the butler who serves Reiko. However, Kazamatsuri shrewdly takes all the credit for solving them. Then the strangest thing happens. Kazamatsuri wins the World Police Championship, which is also called the Olympics for police officers, by luck and becomes the world’s best detective. Made an honorary citizen of Kokuritsu City, Kazamatsuri gets a pair of accommodation coupons for a hot spring inn, which he gives as a gift to his long-time maid Mitsukawa. This hot spring is a secret hot spring deeper into the interior than Okutama. Hearing that it has always been famous as a “village of beauties”, Kazamatsuri declares that he is going too.\n\nHe and Mitsukawa arrive at the inn called Urashima Honjin. When the clerk Kanamori greets them, a woman’s scream comes from the direction of the storehouse. Kazamatsuri rushes over to find a trembling guest, Sato Natsuki, standing in front of the storehouse and a serving lady named Maeda Toshiko desperately trying to open the lattice door. Blood drips from a gap in the netting, and then they discover that the proprietress, Kodama Kinue, is dead.\n\nAt that moment, Reiko is in a limousine driven by Kageyama. She seems happy to line up her newly purchased shoes, which she will be bringing along on the weekend cruise to Singapore. Then, she receives a message from Kazamatsuri, who sounds excited about the possible murder case that occurred at a hot spring which he had visited in private. An investigation is launched at the scene. The storehouse was locked from the inside, and Kinue died from a blow to the head by a vase. She is the only one who has the key to the storehouse. Strangely, the dead body was on its back with the face looking at the ceiling, but the mascara on both eyes ran towards the left. Kazamatsuri questions people related to the inn. \n\nKodama Kazumi and Kotomi are daughters of Kinue’s husband’s former marriage, and they have been running the inn with Kinue. However, it appears that they have been fighting to be her successor. Toshiko has been bullied by the two sisters and even overworked by Kinue. The head chef, Tezuka, has a prison record for assault. When Kazamatsuri examines the crime scene again, he discovers a new sash decorated with camellias placed inside a wooden box. Furthermore, one of the coins at the feet of the statue of a Buddhist deity has fallen off. That night, while Kazamatsuri goes to take a bath, he passes a door with a notice saying, ‘Please do not open’. When he tries to open the door, he is stopped by Kanamori, who is passing by. Kanamori starts to talk about the reason why they do not open up this space.\n\n~~ Adapted from the novel “Nazotoki wa Dinner no Ato de” (謎解きはディナーのあとで) by Higashikawa Tokuya (東川篤哉).",

      "synopsis": "Labors are robots used in various industries like construction. With their introduction to Japan, a new type of crime became prevalent: Labor Crime. To combat this, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police created a unit of Patrol Labors to help. The story is set in Tokyo in 2013, and we follow “third generation” of Patlabor. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police has disbanded Section 2 Division 1 of police robots, and Section 2 Division 2 barely has survived the budget cuts forced upon the police due to the long recession. What problems will the unit face now?\n\n(Source: MyDramaList)\n\n~~ Adapted from the manga series \"Mobile Police Patlabor\" (機動警察パトレイバー) by Yuki Masami (ゆうきまさみ).",

      "synopsis": "The arrogant Yabe Kenzo, who has been unwittingly solving difficult cases thanks to a combination of good luck and mix-ups around him, returns with his subordinate Akiba Harando, the computer nerd. Although the submissive Akiba does not shrink back from Yabe’s treatment, something unusual arises in their relationship this time. Yabe finds himself squaring off against his strongest rival to date.\n\nGenius scientist Deep Manabu, who has invented “God Eye Joe”, artificial intelligence customized for criminal investigations, has been solving successive cases that even the FBI and Scotland Yard have given up on. He announces that he will use it to catch a murderer called the “referee of the dark”, whom the Japanese police are helpless against. With no room to maneuver, the police commissioner assigns Yabe to be the full-time investigator in order to shift responsibility.\n\nUnaware of this, Yabe heads to a hot spring area with eyewitness sightings of the “referee of the dark” in high spirits. There is a landslide, and an inn is cut off like a remote island. Then, a company president who is a guest at the inn is murdered. Under Yabe’s supervision, the proprietress of the inn, Yamakawa Tamao and her guests split into groups to search the surroundings for clues. \nThe murderer’s personal effects are discovered in the direction of the woods, and Yabe gives chase with Akiba. Meanwhile, Deep Manabu has been at work on analyzing the case. A fierce battle of wits is about to unfold between the man with the wig and the man who uses artificial intelligence in the investigation of this bloodthirsty killer.\n\n(Source: jdramas)",

If he accomplishes what no one has done before, he would finally build an observatory on the mountain’s summit with the intention of staying there alone in the winter. He will be able to observe the weather in order to advance meteorological studies even though it may be at the cost of his own life. Burning with a conviction that the country cannot be changed if no commoner demonstrates it first, Itaru has the support of his parents and younger brother but Chiyoko is absolutely anxious. She is convinced that her husband will certainly die of such recklessness if she lets him go alone, and decides to climb Mt Fuji together with him. However, this is vehemently opposed by her mother-in-law Tomiko who berates her that her place is at home, and Chiyoko apparently reconsiders. In order to join Itaru, she hides this plan from the people around her, deceives Tomiko and does everything possible to finally carry it out. On the summit of Mt Fuji in midwinter – a feat no one has yet achieved, husband and wife battle the cold and altitude sickness as they begin their observations",

Because he chose money over title and power, his career progression has been slower than his peers. Kaji gets demoted to Teito Medical University Hospital’s Takamatsu 24th Branch Hospital for assisting in Daimon Michiko’s surgery. He calls Michiko a demon and treats her like the god of pestilence as a result of this demotion and the numerous troubles he has to suffer.\n\nThen, Kaji is transferred to Teito Medical University Hospital’s Oarai 8th Branch Hospital in the town of Oarai, Ibaraki Prefecture. Hailed as a super doctor from Tokyo, Kaji feels smug. On his first day of work, Mifune Haruka, the daughter of a Diet member, is urgently hospitalised for appendicitis. At the same time, a poor old man called Tanami Shigeo, whom Kaji helped in the street, is also admitted and found to have a serious illness that cannot be cured.\n\nSo Kaji has a wealthy patient whose surgery will be easy vs a poor patient whose surgery will be difficult. He tries to give priority to Haruka, which triggers opposition from rookie surgeon Misaki Kenta who believes that money is not necessary to save a person’s life. What will Kaji’s choice be in the end?",

      "synopsis": "The body of a young lady, who had been fatally stabbed in a back alley of Yokohama's shopping and entertainment district, is discovered. Four detectives from the Fourth Section of Minato-cho Police Precinct's Criminal Affairs Division \" Togashi Masayoshi, Iinuma Reiko, Shibata Yasuharu and Yamashita Manabu \" quickly rush to the scene. Togashi finds something in the pocket of the dead body and nonchalantly hides it in his own suit. He presumes Reiko and the others will turn a blind eye even though they have noticed it.\r\n\r\nDetectives from the prefectural police's First Investigative Division arrive shortly after that. The members of the Fourth Section, who have been deprived of their right to investigate by the First Investigative Division, dejectedly walk away from the scene. However, they secretly begin their own investigation.\r\n\r\nThree days later, Satonaka Keiichiro, the Fourth Section's new chief, arrives. Satonaka himself believes he has been demoted to the precinct because of he denounced the unfair appointment of the prefectural police chief's nephew. However, the objective of Maejima Ryuzo, the head of police administration who sent him into Minato-cho Police Precinct, is to let Satonaka keep tabs on Togashi and the Fourth Section. Maejima warns Satonaka that there is a \"bad rumor\" about the Fourth Section.\r\n\r\nTogashi and the others are seen as misusing their high arrest rate and frequently disobeying the orders of the prefectural police. In fact, they are even suspected of all kinds of illegal activities which include extorting confessions under duress, having cosy ties with crime syndicates and accepting bribes. Tokunaga Yasushi, the former section head who was investigating the facts, had lost his footing on the rooftop of a building while pursuing a robber and had fallen to his death... Was Tokunaga's death really an accident?!\r\n\r\nSatonaka regards his new subordinates with caution but the four of them are unexpectedly affable and excellent detectives, especially Togashi who is a stimulating and gallant man. They give Satonaka a thorough report on the investigation into the murder which occurred three days ago, and say that they are searching for eyewitnesses in line with the prefectural police's position that it was a \"random attack\". He feels relieved to see their serious manner. However, several days later, Satonaka discovers that their entire report was nonsense...!",

      "synopsis": "Four high school students died of heart attack mysteriously. A reporter from Central Newspaper, Asakawa, was determined to find out the truth. He learned that all 4 students watched a video tape 2 weeks before they died, so he obtained the tape and watched it, trying to solve the mystery. However, he did not see anything unusual in the tape, which is a music video of a popular singer. Nevertheless, another man who also watched the tape 2 weeks ago died of heart attack. Asakawa was afraid that he would die after 2 weeks, so he seeked help from Takayama Ryuji, who specialized in paranormal phenomenon and seemed to have a mysterious past. After computerized digital analysis, they found out that the video was cursed and whoever saw it only had 13 days left to live.\n\n(Source: DramaWiki)\n\n ~~ Adapted from the novel  \"Ring\" (リング)  by Suzuki Koji (鈴木光司)",

In the afternoon, she lends a ear to residents’ complaints at the inquiry counter of Komagome Chuo Police Precinct’s Community Safety Division. At night, she obtains information from regular customers at the small restaurant which her grandmother Ume, a former police woman, runs. Once a case occurs, Sakura will hide her identity and go undercover. She is actually a special investigator under the orders of “Iron Lady” Igarashi Kyoko, the chief of the police precinct. Sakura partners the hot-blooded detective Takeuchi Masato whom she frequently encounters at investigation scenes, and unlocks the mysteries of the cases.",

The broadcast of the show was suspended indefinitely after the 10th episode, with only the 11th and final episode left. The sudden suspension of the broadcast was attributed to the production company losing communication with DJ Khaled because of his busy schedule. After two months of suspension, the production company said that they had resolved the issue and that they would be resuming production, but the final contestant had already abandoned the show and was busy with another one.",

The post-war recovery and high economic growth serve as the basis for him to achieve the breakup and privatisation of the electricity business. As a follower of Fukuzawa Yukichi, he inherited the spirit of independence, self-respect and the people. He rose up alone from the ruins of the war. It was the fight of an unconventional, stubborn old man over 70 with an indomitable will. Minister of Trade and Industry Ikeda Hayato admired Matsunaga like a father while Prime Ministers Yoshida Shigeru and Konoe Fumimaro, Shirasu Jiro (Takagawa Yuya) and others were in awe of his unfathomable passion.",

      "synopsis": "Detective Mochizuki Akira, who was kidnapped as a child, still goes for regular counselling sessions at the recommendation of Tachibana Kyoka, a physician of the police hospital. One day, a creepy doll addressed to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department is delivered. The same scar from a burn that Mochizuki’s kidnapper inflicted on her is on the doll’s arm. It is accompanied by a message (in kanji) “I wish for a reunion/resumption”. Does this mean the kidnapper from 20 years ago wants to meet her? Or is this a proclamation that kidnappings will resume? \nMochizuki visits her former boss, Yamaji Tetsuo, who also rescued her, in order to ask about the details of the kidnapping case 20 years ago which she has been repressing. The only thing she remembers is the wrist watch that the criminal wore. But at that moment, Mochizuki is notified of the kidnapping of a 9-year-old girl on her mobile phone. Furthermore the same case keeps happening. \nOn the other hand, Yamaji is investigating the dead body of the secretary of a Diet lawmaker, which was discovered within his jurisdiction. Although it is clearly considered a murder, the investigation is called off because of the orders of the head of the First Investigative Division, Kokubo Yuji, and treated as a suicide. Feeling suspicious about this, Yamaji secretly asks medical examiner, Mikami Kaoru, to run a check. Mikami reluctantly accepts. He contacts a mysterious man and makes some disturbing move. \nMochizuki tells her boss, the director Asano Yoshinori, about the doll as well as the connection between the rash of simultaneous kidnappings this time and the case 20 years ago, but he does not pay attention. However, Kariya Masaru, who belongs to the Second Special Investigation Fourth Section, offers to assist her. The two of them start to investigate similar cases in the past without Asano’s permission, but are astonished that all the investigation records at that time have been deleted from the police database. Moreover, the next morning the investigation task force is notified of the signals from the mobile phone of the missing girl, and Mochizuki and Kariya race to the scene but… \nAs the case enters a new phase, Mochizuki starts to worry about what she should do when she confronts the criminal who kidnapped her 20 years ago. Yukihara Natsumi appears before Mochizuki. Meanwhile, Umekawa Naoko, whom the police has identified as a person related to the case, comes.",

      "synopsis": "At the venerable Fukumaru Department Store in Kobe, Samejima Shizuo, who worked her way up from a part-timer, has been through a lot and built a career at the western confectionery department. She became a full-fledged employee following the success of a renewal plan of the store, which she handled besides western confectionery. However, she is assigned to the all-male external sales department as the only female in a sudden personnel transfer and also because it is the intention of the managing director, Benikura Eiichi. In truth, various members are being assembled so that the store can link up with the customers of the well-connected, charismatic Hatori Shiro, in preparation for his retirement. Shizuo’s husband, Kanno Hisaomi, who works for the same department store group and currently lives in Tokyo, understands her role. Shizuo has been successful in her work all this while. Although she is disconcerted and out of her element in the world of external sales, she goes to customer places with the aim of completing deals. An external sales staff takes care of customers every need – from jewellery, cosmetics, wedding favours to home improvements. It is a completely different world from the customers Shizuo has played host to so far. Furthermore, these “upper class” people who appear snobbish on the surface, have families, setbacks, sorrow, glamour and dreams too. Shizuo pushes ahead with the network of contacts that she had cultivated at the western confectionery department and store development section as well as her own self-motivation. There are two persons who give her a hard time at every turn. Ochi Takashi, her superior and the section head of the department, and Masuya Shuhei, her slightly “flawed” junior and rival. Masuya, who comes from a wealthy Nara family, joined the department store after graduating from a famous private university. He is, in a sense, an elite. Even after his transfer to the external sales department, he fully uses his family connections and meets his quota without effort. Shizuo ends up finding out his secret on the way back from a friend’s wedding ceremony. She struggles with her quota and demanding customer requests every day. There are all sorts of customers like the graceful, gentle wife of a distinguished man from an old samurai family, Kurahashi Kazuko; the nagging wife of a hospital director, Tsuru Akiko; a trouble making customer, Shimada Goro; and a Thai businessman. In the midst of this, Shizuo secures Mitani Juri, who has moved from Tokyo, as a new customer. However, she causes some trouble for Juri. While Shizuo is in despair, she hears news of the sudden death of her Thai businessman customer. He has left word of an outrageous wish for his funeral arrangements.\n\n~~ Adapted from the 2013 novel \"Jouryuu Kaikyuu Fukumaru Hyakkaten Gaishoubu\" by Takadono Madoka.",

      "synopsis": "This is the strange story about two women who work in the Marunouchi business district in Tokyo: a 34-year-old \"old miss\" and a 22-year-old who is just waiting for a marriage partner to come along. Although friends, the two eventually battle it out over one man.\r\nThe 34-year-old Tamako is considered an \"old miss\" at work. She's fairly attractive, good at her job, and has her own ideas about fashion and how she should lead her life. In other words, Tamako is a good-looking \"adult\" woman. So why is she still single?\r\nAt work, the new female recruits come in year after year, but all they've got going for them is good looks because there's certainly nothing on the inside. Tamako forgets that she was once the same way, so she gets upset at the likes of them. Even so, she doesn't want to quit working. After all, she has to support herself.\r\nIt's not like Tamako doesn't have a boyfriend, though...actually, she's having an affair. Her lover's name is Shiro, and he's 3 years older than her. She realizes that there isn't much in store for the future, but for now, it's the best thing going.\r\nIs this the kind of love life that I was looking for? Is this how I wanted to spend my life at 34? Tamako is discontent and has all kinds of reservations about herself.\r\nChie is a 22-year-old \"office lady.\" She's just like the other girls who are waiting for \"Prince Charming\" to come along. More than work, Chie is always busy worried about \"Mr. Right.\"\r\nShe wants to get out of the company and into a marriage! She's rather attractive and has a charming personality, but more than anything, she's young!!\r\nShe wants a good-looking man! Unfortunately, though, she hasn't found one at work yet.\r\n\"It isn't supposed to be like this...\"\r\nInside the office, she paints the image that she wouldn't harm a flea, but when she's in the kitchen at work, all she does is talk bad about her older co-workers.\r\n\"I don't want to wind up like them.\"\r\nWhile waiting for her \"Prince Charming,\" Chie is stuck with an aspiring actor; a poor one at that. Tsukasa may be poor, but he's got big dreams. Although she didn't want things to be this way, she's stuck on Tsukasa's \"sex appeal.\"\r\nOne day, an elite, yet handsome guy arrives from New York! His name is Saeki, and he was \"scouted\" by the company to work for them in Tokyo.\r\nBoth Tamako and Chie vow the same thing, \"I'm going to make him my man, and get out of this company!\" But...while fighting over Saeki, Tamako isn't able to break things off with Shiro. The same is true for Chie.\r\n\"Ideals\" and \"reality,\" \"aspirations\" and \"stability\" are what these two are stuck between.\r\n(Source: wiki.d-addicts)",

As she aims to get married by 30, she registers at a marriage agency in order to find a partner.\n\n On the other hand, 35-year-old Taniguchi Takumi is a jobless man who depends on his mother for a living while being absorbed in the world of literature, arts, music and entertainment. He regards himself as a educated idler  and decides to register at the same marriage agency as Yoriko in order to find a rich woman who he can depend on for a living if his mother is no longer around.\n\nThe two of them, who are said to be unable to love and unsuitable for love, get paired up together and, through a number of dates, become closer to each other while viewing the topic of marriage as a mere contract rather than the union of two people who are in love with each other.\n\n(Source: MyDramaList)",

In Chun Tao's most difficult years, it was Liu Xiang Gao who always accompanied and supported her. Although the two weren't husband and wife, they had a very good relationship with each other.\n\nOne day, Chun Tao met an unkempt beggar on the street. She was shocked to find that this beggar was Li Mao. Chun Tao took in Li Mao, and a strange \"family\" of two men and one woman was born. The three of them struggled to maintain their relationship. A precarious balance. Unable to bear the burden of Chun Tao, Liu Xiang Gao ran away from home. Until then, Chun Tao admitted her inner feelings for Liu Xiang Gao. At this juncture, Li Mao attempted to hang himself, and the despair that came over her face enveloped Chun Tao.\n\n (Source: Chinese = Douban || Translation = MyDramaList)",
